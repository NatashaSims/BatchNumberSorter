# BatchNumberSorter

This is my first attempt at a MVC single page application.
The application was originally a job application test, It was never sent to the company as I accepted another job, so I have been playing with it here.
Its a simple program that lets the end user create a batch of numbers and then produce runs against the number set in either acesending or decending order with the time taken to perform the operation in ticks.
It uses Entity Framework, AngularJS, ASP.Net Web API, Autofac and Bootstrap.
